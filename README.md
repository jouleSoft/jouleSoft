Hi there!

Iâ€™m an Hybrid IT Operations Specialist with a wide knowledge on automation. 

I've participated in different challenges such as implementing remote working on an only-office-work environment, designing large scale OS platform fix deployments and automating Service Desk operations in order to make their job faster and easier.

Nowadays, I'm focusing on Monitoring and Observability tools and procedures on different environments like Infrastructure, Communications and Cyber Security in order to improve Hybrid IT Operations groups productivity and efficiency.
 
Automation is my passion, and after many years developing shell scripts on different interpreted languages like Python, Powershell or Bash among others, I would like to address my career on professional profiles related to automated solutions and doing it in an international and multicultural environment.
